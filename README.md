## UX

### User’s Goal

Users want to discover new workout routines. They want to search for a specific workout focus, find new routines, and share opinions in comments.

### Owner’s Goal

The site owner aims to build a fitness community where users will frequently visit the site. By hosting a fitness blog, the site owner can find fitness trends and monetise the site through advertisements, sponsorships, and partnerships.

### Colour Scheme

I found an appealing colour scheme on adobe trends. I wanted something unique and colourful. The blue was used for the background and contrasted with the greens as the primary colours. I used [WebAIM:Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to check the contrast of my colours to ensure they are easy to read and meet accessibility standards.

### Typography

I used [Shadows Into Light](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Shadows+Into+Light) for my headers and titles and paired it with [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) for general text and readability because I wanted to go with a unique font styling and found that these two contrasted well.
